# prismewinter
PrismeWinter is a free, open source Discord bot made in TypeScript.
The project hasn't been updated since 17/12/2021 and has been marked as deprecated as of 24/01/2023.

# why was this made?
This was made in less than 3 days for the top.gg hackathon. It was originally meant to be a nodejs bot, but i decided to work on making this a typescript bot during the last few hours of the hackathon. The bot currently don't have many features and the code is not good, but it works just fine as a placeholder to be improved for other bots.

# current issues
I still have to open source the api this bot relies on for image manipulation commands, so most features are not available.
