# prismewinter
PrismeWinter is a free, open source Discord bot made in TypeScript.

# why was this made?
This was made in less than 3 days for the top.gg hackathon. It was originally meant to be a nodejs bot, but i decided to work on making this a typescript bot during the last few hours of the hackathon. The bot currently dont have many features and its not that good, but im planning to improve this a lot.

# current issues
I still have to open source the api this bot relies on. Every image manipulation command currently works with [Orangy](https://orangybot.me)'s api, i'll open source it in a few days. Until that time you'll have to make your own api to get these commands to work.
